Objective: Implement basic forecasting models you have learned in Python. Used data from Nifty 50 or any other source you prefer. Utilized the yfinance library to fetch the data.

Data Collection:

Use the yfinance library to download historical stock price data.
Choose a stock or index (e.g., Nifty 50) and specify the date range for the data.
Data Preparation:

Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Ensure the data is preprocessed appropriately (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing if necessary).
Model Implementation:

Implemented the following forecasting models:
ARIMA
SARIMA
Exponential Smoothing
Feel free to implement additional models if you are comfortable with them.
Model Evaluation:

Train your models using the training set.
Validate the models using the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters.
Test the models on the test set and evaluate their performance.

Results Presentation:

Show the predictions of each model and compare them with the actual values.
Visualize the results using plots (e.g., line plots for actual vs predicted values).
Calculate and display relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to evaluate the models' performance.
